//! Pause state and auto-enter state management for the always-on mode.
//!
//! Two-tier pause model (changed 2026-05-17 — allowlist UX):
//!
//! - **MASTER_PAUSED** — the user's explicit global force-pause switch.
//!   Set by `TogglePause`, mic-conflict, and audio-output monitors. When
//!   true, EFFECTIVE is forced to true regardless of per-app overrides.
//! - **IDLE_AUTO_PAUSED** — watchdog fired after `idle_pause_secs` with no
//!   voice. Does *not* flip MASTER so focus changes and wake-on-voice can
//!   resume allowlisted apps without a global "lift pause".
//! - **EFFECTIVE_PAUSED** — what the audio pipeline gates on. Derived
//!   from `MASTER_PAUSED || per_app::effective_paused(current_app)`.
//!   The per-app fallback now defaults to **paused for unlisted apps**,
//!   so a fresh install treats every bundle as off-by-default and the
//!   user explicitly resumes the apps they want voice typing in.
//!
//! Callers should still call `is_paused()` for the gating check — its
//! semantics ("am I effectively paused right now?") didn't change.

# Always — Product Specification

The behaviour Always is expected to have. Written from the code as it stands, so
it describes what the product *does*, and — where marked — what it *must* do.

**This file is normative.** If the code and this spec disagree, one of them is a
bug. Say which before changing either.

Items marked ❓ are ones the author of this document could not verify and the
product owner should correct.

## 1. What Always is

An always-on dictation tool for macOS. The user speaks; their words are
transcribed and typed into whatever application has focus. There is no
push-to-talk and no window to click into: the microphone is live, and speech
becomes text.

Two things follow from "always-on", and they shape every rule below:

- **It must never type words the user did not intend to dictate.** A false paste
  is worse than a missed one — it lands in someone else's document, chat, or
  terminal.
- **The user must always know whether it is listening.** An always-on microphone
  with no visible state is not acceptable.

---

## 2. Invariants

Load-bearing rules. Breaking any of these is a regression regardless of what
else improved.

**I1. The listening indicator must be visible when it is shown.**
Not "ordered front", not "alpha 1.0", not "on a screen" — *visible to the user*,
including over full-screen applications. A HUD that renders behind other content
has failed, and every internal signal saying otherwise is irrelevant.

**I2. The listening indicator must stay on screen long enough to be read.**
Minimum 600 ms once shown. Bursts of internal state changes must not tear it
down before a human can see it.

**I3. Nothing is typed into the focused application unless the words were
captured while the daemon was listening, unpaused, and — when My Voice is on —
the speaker was verified.**
The test binds on **capture time, not paste time** (reworded 2026-08-31 at the
product owner's request). What makes a paste legitimate is that the user
authorised the words by speaking them under those conditions; a pause that
arrives afterwards suppresses further *listening*, and does not retroactively
un-authorise speech already given. This is what lets master pause keep the
in-flight utterance (§7) without weakening the rule. It does not loosen I6:
audio captured *during* suppression is still never transcribed or pasted.

**I3a. Under My Voice, no audio reaches transcription unless the utterance
matches the enrolled voiceprint *as a whole*.**
A single matching window during capture is not sufficient authority — it is one
trial in a series, and background media wins it eventually. Every path to STT is
covered: the final transcript and each committed chunk. See §6.

**I4. Only one recorder.** One `rec` process, driven from a single thread. Two
readers of the microphone deadlock or starve each other.

**I5. Only one daemon and one GUI.** Duplicates fight over the microphone and
the socket.

**I6. Audio captured while listening was suppressed must never be transcribed
or pasted.** Applies to every pause source.

**I7. When another application takes the microphone, Always stops immediately
and does not paste.** Two dictation tools must never transcribe the same speech.

**I8. A model may only be offered if it can actually run.** No catalogue entry
may reference an engine with no implementation.

**I9. The user's own voice profile never leaves the machine, and transcripts are
not logged by default in release builds.**

**I10. The app the user is running must be the build that was last built.**
See §12.

## 3. Architecture

Two processes, plus a recorder:

| Process | Role |
|---|---|
| `Always` (Swift, menu bar) | UI: menu bar item, overlay HUD, settings, onboarding. Owns nothing about audio. |
| `always-daemon` (Rust) | Audio capture, VAD, speaker verification, transcription, pasting. |
| `rec` (SoX) | Raw microphone capture, 16 kHz mono 16-bit, one instance, spawned by the daemon. |

The GUI spawns the daemon and talks to it over a Unix domain socket at
`~/Library/Caches/always/always.sock`. Messages are newline-delimited JSON; the
daemon broadcasts events, the GUI sends commands.

**Socket rules:**
- A client falling behind must be told it missed events, never disconnected.
  Dropping the connection makes the GUI reconnect and re-read the entire initial
  state, during which the user sees nothing.
- The GUI must reconnect on its own, with backoff, and respawn the daemon if it
  is genuinely gone.
- The daemon sends its full current state on connect, so a reconnecting GUI is
  never out of sync.

## 4. The dictation lifecycle

1. **Idle** — recorder running, VAD scoring every 30 ms frame.
2. **Speech onset** — frames pass the energy floor and Silero's threshold for
   `onset_ms` (60 ms). The utterance begins; a short pre-buffer (200 ms) is
   prepended so the first syllable is not clipped.
3. **Listening shown** — see §5.
4. **Speaking** — audio accumulates. Long utterances are committed in chunks and
   transcribed as they go, so a two-minute dictation does not wait until the end.
5. **Pause detected** — a tentative silence starts a *speculative* transcription
   in the background, which also pre-warms the grammar LLM for the expected
   final text (§9). If speech resumes, it is discarded.
6. **End of utterance** — silence exceeds the configured window
   (`stt_silence_secs`, default 1.4 s). With adaptive silence on, the window
   extends when the text looks mid-sentence.
7. **Transcribe** — the speculative result is used if still valid, otherwise a
   fresh transcription runs.
8. **Post-process** — filters, glossary corrections, grammar cleanup (§9).
   A rule-filtered utterance (not a hallucination) is still copied to the
   clipboard — no paste, no auto-Enter — so a wrong filter verdict costs a
   manual ⌘V instead of the whole utterance.
9. **Paste** — text is typed into the focused application. If auto-Enter is on,
   Return follows after `auto_enter_delay_ms`.

**Pause tolerance is the difference between dictating and being interrupted.**
Two settings govern it, and the shipped defaults were both too aggressive for
real speech: a 1.4 s silence window ended utterances during ordinary thinking
pauses, and auto-Enter with no grace period then sent the half-finished message.
This instance now runs 1.1 s (lowered from 2.2 s on 2026-08-26 after log
analysis showed real pauses p95 ≈ 1.25 s and the adaptive mid-sentence
extension covering the tail) and 0 ms auto-Enter delay.

❓ The code defaults are still 1.4 s / 0 ms. Product decision needed on whether
to move them for everyone.

## 5. The listening indicator (HUD)

A small floating badge showing what Always is doing.

**States:** Listening · Transcribing (with elapsed seconds after 5 s) ·
Transcribing-with-text · Paused · Resumed · Filtered · Auto-Enter countdown ·
Idle-paused · Low mic volume · correction confirmations.

**Rules:**

- **Activity-only.** It represents something happening — the user speaking, or a
  transcription running. It is not an "app is alive" light and must not sit on
  screen while idle.
- **Visible above everything** (I1). Window level must be above normal and
  full-screen application content. It is a status indicator, and it belongs at
  the same tier as the menu bar, below system alerts.
- **Minimum 600 ms on screen** (I2).
- Follows the active screen and the cursor; must be fully on a screen the user
  is looking at.
- Fixed width, growing height: transcript text wraps within the fixed content
  width — the panel never widens or shifts horizontally as interim text
  changes. In normal mode the panel's height grows to fit the wrapped
  transcript, from the classic 130 pt up to a 200 pt cap (~6 wrapped lines),
  and shrinks back when the text shortens or the state changes. The bottom
  edge stays anchored, so growth is upward and can never push the HUD
  off-screen. Text taller than the cap is head-truncated — a leading "…"
  replaces the oldest words so the words just spoken stay visible. Compact
  mode remains a fixed single truncated line.
- Hidden entirely when paused, disconnected, or when the user selects the hidden
  display mode.
- **Live feedback preempts transient confirmations.** Brief confirmation
  flashes (Pause/Resume, Auto-Enter toggles, low-mic volume, offline
  fallback — 1.5 s to 4 s) normally run their full duration, but if the user
  starts speaking (Listening) or a transcription state arrives while one is
  showing, the flash ends immediately and the live state shows at once.
  Lower-priority states still wait for the flash to finish, so a
  confirmation is never cut short by e.g. a stale state re-emission.

**When "Listening" appears:**

| Situation | Timing |
|---|---|
| My Voice off | On voice onset — immediately. |
| My Voice on | After the speaker is verified — up to ~2 s measured live. Background media and other voices do NOT flash the badge; the indicator appears only for the enrolled user. |

The verify wait under My Voice is the price of the gate doing its job: the
badge must not register audio the user did not produce. An earlier "optimistic
badge on onset" experiment flashed the overlay on every non-user voice (videos,
meetings, sleep-time media) and was reverted at the owner's request — see §6.

**Live transcript text** is shown whenever the daemon produces a provisional
preview — the GUI renders any non-empty partial it receives, during the
transcribing wait *and* while the user is still talking. The daemon, not the
GUI, decides when previews flow. (Previously the GUI discarded previews unless
the active model claimed streaming; that gate is gone.) A model that returns
one finished transcript per utterance must still not claim streaming —
`Transcriber::supports_streaming()` stays `false` for the cloud backend.

The daemon's live-preview loop (`vad.rs`, `preview_cadence`) re-transcribes the
growing buffer on an interval while the user is still talking. Three ways it
arms, in priority order:

1. **Consume mode** (`SetConsumeMode`, regardless of engine) — fast cadence:
   every `CONSUME_STREAM_INTERVAL_MS` (200ms), self-limited to one round trip
   at a time. Unchanged; external consumers (Iris) depend on it, and its
   preview payloads are never prefixed with chunk text.
2. **A genuinely-streaming local engine** (`supports_streaming()` true —
   Nemotron, MoonshineStreaming) — same fast cadence; decode is local and
   cheap. Unchanged.
3. **The `stt_live_preview` preference (default ON)** — non-streaming cloud
   backends (Groq) get a SLOW cadence: at most one preview every
   `LIVE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL_MS` (1.5s), and only after ~1s of NEW audio since
   the last preview (`LIVE_PREVIEW_MIN_NEW_SAMPLES`). Each tick is a full
   cloud round trip, so a minute of continuous dictation costs tens of extra
   API calls, not hundreds. The preview audio is capped to the last ~10s
   (`CONSUME_STREAM_PREVIEW_MAX_SAMPLES`); for chunked long utterances the
   already-settled chunk texts are prefixed (when cheaply available) so the
   overlay shows the whole sentence, not just the open chunk.

Starvation safety for the slow cloud path: a tick is skipped while a
tentative-silence speculation is pending, while a previous preview is still
in flight (`preview_pending` single-flight), and entirely until the speaker
gate has verified the utterance (no API calls for audio that may be dropped).
It never flips the overlay to "Transcribing" — the user is still talking, so
the partial text renders under the listening state. The final transcription
path (speculation → final cut → paste) is untouched by all three arms.

With `stt_live_preview` off, Groq dictation shows no mid-speech previews;
the free speculative preview at a pause (below) still renders once.

---

## 6. My Voice (speaker verification)

Optional. When on, only the enrolled user's voice is transcribed — other people,
television, meeting audio and music are ignored.

**Enrollment** records three passes (normal, lower, louder), each needing 5 s of
voice. Each pass is stored as its own embedding, plus their combined average.

**Scoring:** an utterance's embedding is compared against the enrolled profile;
above the threshold, it is the user.

- Compare against **the best-matching enrolled style**, not only the combined
  average. The average is not equal to any style the user actually speaks in,
  and scoring against it alone costs real similarity for no benefit.
- The model requires **0.5 s of voice minimum** — this is the floor on how fast
  identity can be established, and no tuning removes it.
- Checks repeat as the user speaks, so a long utterance ends when *they* stop,
  not when the room goes quiet.
- Audio that fails is discarded before any transcription is paid for.

**A single matching moment never authorises an utterance.** Verification during
capture is scored on a 1.5 s trailing window, retried every 0.5 s, against the
best of four enrolled embeddings. That is a repeated trial, and against
continuous media it eventually succeeds by chance: measured on 2026-08-31 with a
Hindi video playing, three windows crossed a 0.35 threshold (0.362, 0.365,
0.375) and each one released a whole utterance to the clipboard. So the audio is
re-scored **as a whole** before it can be transcribed, at the same threshold, and
is discarded if the utterance does not match — no matter what an individual
window said. Over the same recording, 42 whole-utterance scores peaked at 0.341;
none reached the bar. Chunks of a long dictation are confirmed the same way
before they are committed, since a committed chunk leaves the buffer for good.

Rejecting requires positive evidence. A fragment too short to embed, or an
embedder error, defers to whatever the in-capture checks already decided — the
confirmation can turn an accept into a reject, never the reverse, and it never
discards chunks that were already confirmed.

**The gate gets stricter while the Mac is playing audio**, but only for the
single-window check: `AUDIO_PLAYING_GATE_BUMP` (0.15) is added to the window bar
and never to the whole-utterance bar. Dictating over music must keep working, and
the owner's Nepali scores 0.45–0.52 — a raised whole-utterance bar of 0.50 would
reject half of it. Missing the raised window bar costs the user latency, not
their words: the whole-utterance check at ~2 s still admits them at the
unraised threshold.

"Is audio playing" is tracked as a **fact**, separately from the audio-output
*pause source* below. The two were the same flag, and because the pause source is
deliberately suppressed whenever My Voice is on (§7), the fact was suppressed
with it — the strictness bump was unreachable in the only configuration that
needed it, for as long as it existed.

**No trust window.** An earlier build remembered a confirmed match for a period
(10 s, later 5 min) and let the badge appear on voice onset without re-verifying
inside that window. That made the overlay flash on every non-user voice —
videos, meetings, media played while sleeping — and the mic kept capturing audio
that would never be the user's, which blocked dictation until the media stopped.
Reverted at the owner's request: every sentence re-proves identity from scratch.
The cost is up to ~2 s of verify wait at the start of each utterance under the
gate (§5); the benefit is that the badge and the mic only ever engage for the
enrolled user.

**Threshold** is a preference (currently 0.40). Measured on the owner's profile:
their own voice scores 0.50–0.67, other audio scores below 0.30 in the vast
majority of cases. ❓ The value should be re-derived if the voiceprint is
re-recorded.

## 7. Pause model

Listening can be suppressed by several independent sources. They do not
overwrite each other — a manual pause survives a call ending.

| Source | Trigger | Clears when |
|---|---|---|
| Master | User toggles pause (shortcut or menu) | User resumes |

The master pause shortcut is configurable via Settings → Shortcuts →
"Master Pause / Mute" or `always config set shortcut_master_pause <combo>`.
Default: `ctrl+alt+shift+p`. Supports the Fn/Globe key as a standalone
shortcut (`fn`) — the Fn key fires as a `flagsChanged` event on macOS,
not `keyDown`, so a dedicated `CGEventTap` catches it alongside `rdev`.
| Per-app | Focused app is on the paused list | Focus moves to an allowed app |
| Mic conflict | Another app holds the microphone | Mic free for ~3 s (§7.1) |
| Audio output | System audio is playing (suppressed entirely when My Voice is on — the gate already ignores non-user voices, so music must not stop dictation) | Playback stops |
| Idle | No voice for `idle_pause_secs` | Voice detected again |
| No GUI | Daemon lost its last client | A client connects |

**Rules:**
- Any active source suppresses capture. The explicit global resume clears all of
  them at once.
- On resume, audio queued by the recorder during the suppressed period is
  **discarded** (I6). The recorder never stops, so its buffer holds several
  seconds of exactly the audio Always was meant to ignore.
- An utterance already being recorded when a pause source fires is **not**
  aborted mid-capture (only a mic conflict does that, §7.1). It finishes
  recording and is transcribed in full; the pause decides only whether the
  result is pasted.
- **A pause that arrives mid-utterance normally drops the paste**, so a
  transcript cannot leak into a window the user has since moved to. The text
  is not lost — it is held in the single-slot filtered buffer and the overlay
  offers "press ⌃⌥V to paste anyway".
- **Exception — master pause with unchanged focus (changed 2026-08-31, at the
  product owner's request):** when Master is the *only* active source and the
  focused app is still the one the utterance began in, the transcript **is
  pasted** rather than dropped. Muting means "stop listening", not "discard
  what I already said", and with focus unchanged there is no other window to
  leak into. The originating bundle id is captured before the first frame is
  recorded (`pause::set_dictation_origin_app`) and compared at paste time; an
  unknown origin fails closed to the drop. Every other source — per-app, idle,
  mic conflict, audio output, no-GUI — keeps the drop unchanged, because those
  genuinely mean "this window must not receive dictation".
- Focus-driven pause/resume must be silent — switching windows must not flash
  badges.

### 7.1 Microphone conflicts

Another application taking the microphone is detected within about a second.

- Capture stops **immediately**, mid-utterance, not at the next loop boundary.
- Words captured before the cut are still transcribed and recorded in the log,
  but **never pasted** — the other app is about to paste its own version.
- Listening resumes only after the microphone has been continuously free for
  about 3 s. Dictation apps release the mic between phrases; resuming on the
  first free moment means Always starts listening to speech still aimed at the
  other app.

### 7.2 Recorder health and respawn

The `rec` (SoX) process runs for the daemon's lifetime and is only replaced
when genuinely unhealthy. CoreAudio "buffer overrun" messages trigger a respawn
only as a **rate**: at least 64 overruns within one 60 s window. Overruns are
**not counted while capture is deliberately gated** (pause, mic conflict) —
during a gate nobody drains the pipe, SoX blocks, and CoreAudio discarding
callbacks is expected backpressure, not a device fault. (The previous
lifetime-cumulative counter condemned a healthy recorder after any single
benign backpressure episode — 291 respawns in 2 days, each paying a ~4.5 s
device cold start.)

When a respawn does happen, the old recorder is killed and reaped **before**
the replacement is spawned, so two `rec` processes never hold the input device
at the same time (I4).

---

## 8. Models and transcription backends

A cloud backend and a set of downloadable local models. Local models run
offline; the cloud backend is faster to start and needs an API key.

**Rules:**
- **Never list a model that cannot run** (I8). Every catalogue entry must name an
  engine with a real implementation, a correct download size, and a checksum.
- A local model may be armed as fallback for the cloud backend; failures fall
  back silently but are logged.
- Switching models takes effect on the next utterance.

**Streaming models available:** `moonshine-tiny-streaming-en`,
`moonshine-small-streaming-en`, `moonshine-medium-streaming-en`, `nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b`.
These engines expose partial text events (§5). Moonshine models are English only;
Nemotron 3.5 supports 40 language-locales with auto language detection.

### 8.1 NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 ASR — implementation notes

Nemotron 3.5 ASR Streaming 0.6B is implemented via the `parakeet-rs` crate (0.3.6,
pinned for ort 2.0.0-rc.12 compatibility). It provides multilingual streaming ASR
with 40 language-locales, auto language detection, and punctuation.

**Model files:** The ONNX export from HuggingFace
(`pantinor/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-onnx`) publishes four loose files, whose
names `parakeet-rs` looks for exactly:

| File | Bytes |
|---|---|
| `encoder.onnx` | 42,164,972 |
| `encoder.onnx.data` | 2,454,405,120 |
| `decoder_joint.onnx` | 97,590,054 |
| `tokenizer.model` | 406,554 |

Total 2,594,566,700 bytes (2474 MB). It is a directory model and needs the
`local-stt` feature.

**Distribution — this model has no archive.** HuggingFace serves each file
separately and offers no repo-tarball endpoint, so the usual "one `.tar.gz` URL"
catalogue shape cannot express it. Pointing `url` at a constructed `.tar.gz` path
returns 404 and produces a model that downloads nothing and spins forever — the
entry shipped that way once and had to be removed.

Catalogue entries may therefore declare a **file list** (`ModelInfo::files`)
instead of `url`. Each file carries its own URL, SHA256 and size; the daemon
fetches them into a `.downloading` staging directory, verifies each against its
checksum as it lands, and only then renames the directory into place and writes
the `.verified` marker. An interrupted download can never leave a half-populated
directory that looks installed. Progress is aggregated from the declared sizes,
since there is no single content-length to report.

**Settings → Models** shows the catalogue's advertised `size_mb` (an estimate)
before download, and the model's *actual* on-disk byte count once downloaded —
summed across every file for a directory model like Nemotron. Read directly by
the Swift app from `~/Library/Application Support/always/models/` (the daemon
doesn't compute this itself); falls back to the advertised estimate if the
real bytes can't be read.

`url` and `files` are mutually exclusive; a test enforces this, along with real
checksums, real sizes, `is_directory`, filenames that cannot escape the model
directory, and a declared `size_mb` that agrees with the sum of the parts.

**Implementation details:**
- `LoadedEngine::Nemotron` holds a **shared, read-only `parakeet_rs::NemotronHandle`** (loaded via `NemotronHandle::load(path, None)`), never a bare `Nemotron` instance. Every call — the one-shot final path and each streaming session — spawns its own independent `Nemotron::from_shared(&handle)` with fresh decoder state, transcribes, and drops it. This is required, not cosmetic: `Nemotron::transcribe_audio` (the one-shot path) starts by resetting the same cache-aware decode state (`encoder_cache`, LSTM `state_1`/`state_2`, `last_token`) that a concurrent `transcribe_chunk` streaming sequence depends on, and the streaming path releases `self.engine`'s mutex between chunks (so a slow decode doesn't block unrelated daemon work) — sharing one `Nemotron` between the two paths let the daemon's independent "speculative transcription" (fires ~240ms after any pause, unrelated to streaming preview state) silently corrupt an in-progress streaming decode. Per-call isolation removes the shared mutable state entirely; no additional locking is needed.
- Non-streaming transcription uses `Nemotron::from_shared(&handle)` then `transcribe_audio(&samples)`
- `LocalTranscriber::transcribe_streaming` clones the handle out of `self.engine` once, then uses stateful `transcribe_chunk(&audio_chunk)` calls on its own `Nemotron` instance with 560ms chunks (8960 samples @ 16kHz)
- Each preview snapshot spawns a fresh (already-reset) instance, pads its final chunk to 8960 samples, and sends three silent flush chunks
- VAD consume-mode previews call `transcribe_streaming`; preview events contain cumulative text because the Swift monitor replaces its stored partial transcript on each event
- The final paste path remains non-streaming and uses `transcribe_audio(&samples)`
- Rust test coverage covers the chunk-splitting/padding math (560ms sizing, ragged-tail zero-padding, flush-tail count) without a loaded model; real Nemotron model inference and long-running memory behavior remain unverified by automated tests since that needs ~2.5GB of real weights this repo doesn't ship
- The loader auto-detects English-only vs multilingual variants from the encoder ONNX graph
- Multilingual variant accepts a target language code via `apply_nemotron_language()` → `set_target_lang()`, driven by the Settings language picker (Swift) and the daemon's existing `cfg.lang` plumbing (`uds_server.rs::set_language`). **Known format mismatch**: `cfg.lang` and this model's own catalogue entry use bare ISO 639-1 codes ("es", "ja", "zh", ...), but parakeet-rs's `PROMPT_DICTIONARY` only has bare-code entries for most languages — "ja"/"zh" require locale-tagged form ("ja-JP", "zh-CN"). A bare "ja"/"zh" selection is rejected by `set_target_lang` and falls back to auto-detect with a logged warning rather than failing the transcription. Mapping "ja"→"ja-JP"/"zh"→"zh-CN" before the call is a known follow-up, not yet done.

**Why it was previously absent:**
The original implementation attempt failed because:
- `transcribe-rs` did not include a Nemotron engine
- The published ONNX exports did not fit transcribe-rs's Parakeet loader
- The catalogue entry had incorrect metadata (600 MB vs 2258 MB download, no checksum, pointed at .nemo archive)

The solution was to use `parakeet-rs` instead, which provides a dedicated Nemotron
implementation compatible with the ONNX Runtime this project already depends on.

## 9. Text pipeline

Between transcription and the keyboard:

1. **Hallucination filter** — rejects the known failure modes of speech models:
   empty output, "thank you"/"bye" family, subtitle credits, repeated tokens,
   gibberish, low-confidence segments.
2. **Vocabulary bias** — the user's glossary is sent to the model as a hint so
   domain terms transcribe correctly. **The hint must never reach the user's
   text**: these models echo their prompt back, especially on short or quiet
   audio, and the echo is indistinguishable from speech to everything downstream.
3. **Glossary corrections** — known mistranscriptions mapped to canonical terms.
4. **Snippets / text expansion.** ❓ Not verified in detail.
5. **Grammar cleanup** — an LLM pass, on by default (`postprocess_enabled`).
   The blocking call at paste time is pre-warmed in the background so it
   usually lands as a cache hit (or joins the identical in-flight request):
   - **Un-chunked utterance:** the tentative-silence speculation warms the
     grammar key for its transcript as soon as speculative STT returns.
   - **Chunked utterance:** the paste-time call is keyed on the *join* of the
     corrected chunks (+ tail), a key the per-chunk corrections never touch.
     Each chunk that finishes its per-chunk correction warms the joined
     transcript once every committed chunk is settled; a voiced tail's
     speculation warms join + tail. Warm and paste build the request through
     the same builder (`correction_request::build`), which is what keeps the
     cache keys byte-identical.
6. **Corrections** — the user can log a correction for a wrong transcription;
   passive capture of clipboard edits is available but off by default.

---

## 9a. First-run setup

Shown **once**, to someone who has never been through it, and never again.

Two steps:

1. **Permissions.** Microphone and Accessibility are required and gate the
   Continue button — without them nothing works at all. Input Monitoring is
   offered but never blocks: it enables the global shortcuts, not dictation.
   The window polls permission state, so granting in System Settings updates it
   without a restart.
2. **My Voice.** The three enrollment recordings, inline. Always skippable —
   "Skip for now" and "Finish without it" both complete setup.

**Completion is a recorded fact, not an inference.** It was previously derived
from "is a Groq API key saved?", which was wrong in both directions: a user
running a local model has no key and was re-shown the welcome window on every
launch forever with no way to stop it, while a user who already had a key never
saw onboarding at all and was never walked through permissions. Completion is
now stored under `onboardingCompletedV1` and written the moment the user
finishes or skips.

**Existing installs are never shown it.** On first run of a build carrying this
flag, a saved API key or a recorded voice profile is taken as proof the user has
used the app before, and the flag is retro-marked. Upgrading must not greet a
working setup with a welcome window.

**The window is always dismissable.** No step may hold a first-run user hostage.
The Groq API key was deliberately removed from this flow for that reason — it is
not required (local models need none) and it now lives in Settings → Models.

## 11. Logging and diagnostics

- Daemon log: `~/Library/Logs/Always/always.YYYY-MM-DD`, JSON lines.
  `always logs --pretty` renders it.
- **Transcripts are only logged in debug builds**, or with
  `ALWAYS_LOG_TRANSCRIPTS=1` (I9).
- Overlay timing instrument: `ALWAYS_OVERLAY_TIMING=1` writes each hop —
  event received, reached the main thread, ordered on screen, with window level
  and screen geometry — to `~/Library/Logs/Always/overlay-timing.log`. Off by
  default.
- Any user-visible latency claim must be measured from **first speech**, not
  from an internal marker that fires later.

## 12. Build, install, run

`scripts/dev-rebuild.sh` is the only supported path. It kills the app and
daemon, builds Rust and Swift, deploys to `/Applications/Always.app`, relaunches,
and **verifies the running processes are newer than the binaries** — exiting
non-zero if not.

**Nothing is "done" until the new build is running** (I10). "Built" and
"deployed" are different claims, and only "running" is testable.

## 13. Open questions for the product owner

1. ~~Trust window at 5 minutes — how much badge-flashing is acceptable in
   exchange for an instant indicator?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-30:** reverted
   entirely. The optimistic badge flashed on every non-user voice (videos,
   meetings, sleep-time media) and blocked dictation while media played. Every
   sentence now re-verifies; the ~2 s verify wait is accepted as the cost of the
   gate.
2. ~~Auto-Enter with no delay~~ / ~~silence window at 1.4 s~~ — **resolved for this
   instance 2026-08-05**: 2.2 s and 800 ms, after both cut the user off
   mid-thought. Open question is whether the code defaults should follow.
4. ~~Should a streaming local model become the default so live text works?~~
   **Resolved 2026-08-04:** `moonshine-small-streaming-en` downloaded and made
   active, so the overlay's live-text path has something to render. English
   only — revisit if multilingual dictation matters more than live text.
5. Mic conflict discards the interrupted sentence rather than pasting it — right
   call?
6. ~~Nemotron — fix and restore, or leave out?~~ **Resolved 2026-08-15:**
   Nemotron is restored with state-reset, padded 560 ms chunk processing,
   trailing-frame flushes, and intact UTF-8 partial transcript updates.
